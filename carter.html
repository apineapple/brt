<div style="margin-top: -100px;"><h2 style="padding-right: 100px; text-align: right; font-family: title;">overview</h2>  <p>King Carter or Cheikhuana is a founding member of the [slUMs] movement and is very close friends with MIKE. He has mostly gone off the map as he hasn’t released music in a very long time. He’s still friends with people in the movement and his legacy is obvious.</p></div>

<div style="margin-top: -50px;"><h2 style="padding-right: 100px; font-family: title;">key project: <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Bold', sans-serif;">prayer's ain't enough</span></h2>  <p>Prayer’s Ain’t Enough is the exception to the fact that King Carter hasn’t released a whole lot of music. Released in 2019, Prayer’s Ain’t Enough is the first project King Carter released since the [slUMs] soundcloud albums released in 2015. He hasn’t gained much traction, being off the scene for four years before releasing music. The album was produced by Rago Foot, a producer and lyric writer from London. The album has two features from fellow collective member, MIKE, and the project follows a theme of talking about American politics over beats having a murky and musty vibe similar to many [slUMs] projects.

<div style="margin-top: -300px; padding-bottom: 100px;"><h2 style="padding-right: 100px; text-align: right;font-family: title;">key song: <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Bold', sans-serif;">run it up</span></h2><br><p style="margin-left: 500px;">Run It Up is a song featuring fellow [slUMs] artist MIKE over a distorted and grimey beat with a looped squashed voice. MIKE takes the first verse while King Carter takes the second, splitting the song 50-50. These lyrics below are symbolic of King Carter’s founding of [slUMs]. Even though he’s been off the map for 4 years, he’s maintained his voice and motivation to be a role model and advocate for those suffering.
<br><br><span style="font-size: 18px;">“King Carter slums, we’re the voice for the voiceless<br>
The hope for the hopeless”</span><br><br>King Carter shares his appreciation for black mothers and his urge to give back. Gratefulness has become a theme in the [slUMs] movement, especially how it relates to your parents. Karma is a general moral standard for living stemming from Hinduism and Buddhism, and sharing love that is given to you is a huge part of this idea. <br><br><span style="font-size: 18px;">"Single parent home, momma made it work.<br>
Show me what the day is worth<br>
Shout out to my n*ggas hold it down for their momma<br>
That’s good karma
