<div style="margin-top: -50px;"><h2 style="padding-right: 100px; font-family: title;">key project: <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Bold', sans-serif;">forever, ya girl
</span></h2>  <p>Forever, Ya Girl is KeiyaA’s one and only album released. This album has a vibe uniquely between funk and grime taking influence from Earl Sweatshirt and George Clinton equally. KeiyaA is introspective in the way that she talks about her mental health and what she wants out of life. This truly is the only album of its kind.</p></div>
<div style="margin-top: -300px; padding-bottom: 100px;"><h2 style="padding-right: 100px; text-align: right;font-family: title;">key song: <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Bold', sans-serif;">forreal??</span></h2><br><p style="margin-left: 500px;">Forreal explores hypersexuality and sensitivity expertly. KeiyaA talks about needing to be emotionally in tune with both her parter and herself before she is able to move into sexual relationships. 
<br><br><span style="font-size: 18px;">“Before I put this pussy on your sideburns, I
Need to check in with my heart and mind<br>
And make sure that we aren't movin from a place of lack<br>
Before I let you give it to me fast and slow<br>
There's some things my spirit has to know<br>
Sometimes you gotta eat that thang from the back
”</span><br><br>This line shows the capitalist ideology Akai Solo is working against. He’s on a ship with people who care about each other and their well being rather than the bounty. This also a subtle reference to an anime Cowboy Bebop where the crew goes around bounty hunting, but throughout the show, they learn that their crew’s safety and happiness is more important to them than anything else. In capitalism people are focused on the bounty, not each other.<br><br><span style="font-size: 18px;">"Comrades who are concerned with the state of the ship, not the status that comes with the swelling bounty, aw shit"</span><br><br></p></div>
